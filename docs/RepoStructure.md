## Breakdown of the Structure

### 💻 `/agents`

This directory houses all the code for the endpoint clients.

  * **Platform-Specific Folders** (`windows-agent`, `linux-agent`, `macos-agent`): Each agent is a standalone project. This separation is clean and allows for platform-specific build toolchains (e.g., Visual Studio solutions for Windows, Makefiles for Linux).
  * **`shared-logic`**: This is a crucial sub-directory. To avoid duplicating code, any logic common to all agents—like how they serialize data, communicate with the API, or manage their offline cache—should be built as a shared library here. The platform-specific agent projects would then link against this library.

### 🚀 `/platform`

This is the heart of your cloud infrastructure, organized into two main parts.

  * **`services`**: This follows a **microservice architecture**, which is ideal for your project's needs. Each folder contains a distinct service (e.g., `ingestion-svc`, `analysis-svc`). This makes the services independently scalable, deployable, and maintainable.
  * **`web-console`**: The frontend is a separate application from the backend services. It will communicate with your backend via the API Gateway.

### 📦 `/packages`

This directory is the key to an efficient monorepo. It contains code shared across different parts of your project, preventing code duplication.

  * **`event-schemas`**: This is arguably the most important shared package. It defines the structure of the data (telemetry) sent from the agents to the cloud. Using a formal schema like **Protocol Buffers** or **Avro** ensures that the agents and the backend services always agree on the data format.
  * **`common-utils`**: For shared TypeScript/Go/Python functions used by multiple backend services (e.g., a standardized logger, database connection helpers).
  * **`ui-components`**: If your `web-console` becomes complex, you can extract reusable components (e.g., charts, tables, buttons) into this shared library.

### 🏗️ `/infra`

Your project requires significant cloud infrastructure. Keeping your **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** in this dedicated directory is a best practice. This allows you to version-control your cloud setup (e.g., databases, message queues, serverless functions) and automate deployments.

## Monorepo Tooling

To manage dependencies, build processes, and testing across the various projects in this repository, you should use a monorepo management tool.

  * **For a JavaScript/TypeScript-heavy backend:** Tools like **Turborepo** or **Nx** are excellent. They can intelligently cache builds and tests, so you only rebuild what has changed, which dramatically speeds up development. You'd typically have a root `package.json` to manage these tools.
  * **For a polyglot (multi-language) environment:** If your backend services are in Go/Python and your agents are in C++/Rust, a more powerful build system like **Bazel** might be considered, though it has a steeper learning curve. For a B.Tech project, focusing on a single language for the backend and using a simpler tool like Turborepo is often more practical.

This structure provides a robust and scalable foundation for your project, allowing you to develop and manage your EDR platform effectively. Good luck\!
